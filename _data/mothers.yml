    - Hello! My name is Choirunnisa Fatima. I love building software products, especially as backend developer. I also have a desire to work on android, devops, testing, and data mining. But frontend is not my thing.
    - I am proudly still an informatics engineering student at Institut Teknologi Bandung, exchange student at University of Bremen, and student researcher at Jacobs University.
    - I am still an adolescent, that's why my life is so confusing (no focuding field and 3 student statuses!). But yeah, currently I'm enjoying lovelife in Germany.

    - Hi, my name is Hayyu' Luthfi Hanifah (yes, with an aphostrophe!). I love reading books and blogging. You can peek my posts and book reviews on <a href="http://heraminerva.tumblr.com/">tumblr</a> and <a href="https://afteryearsofposting.wordpress.com/">wordpress</a>.
    - I have graduated from Institut Teknologi Bandung on October 2016 as a Bachelor of Informatics Engineering. Currently, I'm working at <a href="https://www.traveloka.com">Traveloka</a> as marketing analyst.
    - Yeah, I love data so much! There are still many things about data that I don't know, but that doesn't discourage me. Instead, it makes me want to learn and explore it more.

  - Hi! My name is Khoirunnisa Afifah. I am passionate about security in software engineering. I even wrote a paper about it and presented in a conference. If you are interested, you can find my paper on IEEE Xplore.
  - I have graduated from Institut Teknologi Bandung as a Bachelor of Informatics Engineering on October 2016. Currently, I am working as a software engineer at <a href="https://www.xendit.co">Xendit</a>.
  - Other than security, I love going to interesting places randomly. I also love collecting band-aids from all over the world!

  - Hey geeks! My name is Alifa Nurani Putri. I have already graduated as a Master and Bachelor of Informatics Engineering at Institut Teknologi Bandung. Currently, I am an android developer at <a href="https://www.tokopedia.com">Tokopedia</a>.
  - I love to join any full stack mobile apps development and have portfolios about it, but for now I want to learn as much as I can to be an experienced android developer. Other than that, I am also interested in security, as I wrote my master thesis and a publication about it. One of my dream is to be a technology manager, that's why I need to work professionally in any project I've been working on.
  - Lastly, I love coffee! I would be glad if you asked me about any kind of coffee and would be happy having some shots with you, haha.
