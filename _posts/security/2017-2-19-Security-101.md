Hello, my fellow geeks. I'm here to start a serial post called **Information Security 101**. 

**Disclaimer:** I'm not a pro, I wrote this here so we can learn together. So please tell me if I made mistakes :)

### First, what is the definition of Information Security?
There are four main points of the definition. First, IS is basically a protection. Protection of what? That's the second one, protection of information and system. From who? from authorized access, disclosure, modification, destruction or disruption. And last, the objective is to provide C-I-A.

### Wait, C-I-A? 
Yea, it stands for:
 - **Confidentiality.** 
 You have something and IS will prevent me from knowing or accessing your something.
 - **Integrity.** 
 IS will keep your something as it is if you don't change it.
 - **Availability.** 
 IS ensure you to be able to access your something when you want to access it.

And sometimes C-I-A are expanded to:
- **Authentication**. 
To ensure that you are really who you are.
- **Authorization**. 
To ensure that you are allowed to access your something. 
- **Accountability**. 
Everything you do to your something will be logged. 
- **Nonrepudiation**. 
Someone won't be able to deny if he did a bad thing to your something. IS will provide all the prove.

### Nice, sometimes I hear people talk about Cybersecurity. Is it same to IS? 
Some people <sup>[[5]](#5)</sup><sup>[[6]](#6)</sup> said that cybersecurty is part of information security. Cybersecurity means to protect data that is found in the electronic form. Meanwhile, information security talk about the general form of data, including all those data in the filling cabinet. But it seems that these differences will gradually wane.

### By that definition, IS should cover:
1. **Physical**. Such as have a CCTV in your server room, lock your office, or provide a fire suppression system.
2. **People**. By giving an education on how important of IS to the stakeholders.
```
You can have the best technology, firewalls, Intrusion-Detection systems, biometric devices. 
All it takes is a call to an unsuspecting employee, and thatâ€™s all she wrote, baby. 
They got everything. [7]
```
3. **Technical**. This part is the one that most of the people talking about. By setting up a firewall, antivirus, IDS, encryption and any other cool stuff.
4. **Policy**. At the most top level of our system, we should a set of rules to do specific things (e.g. Password protection policy).

### And how to do all of this stuff? 
In a high-level view, here's what one should do:
1. **Plan.** Including identify your asset, identify all the threat and vulnerabilities, establish policy and procedure.
2. **Do.** Implement all the procedure that you've been made. Steps like secure your servers, encrypt the data, educate the stakeholders are here.
3. **Check.** Audit your system and policy regularly. Maintain your logs and events.
4. **Act.** This will include how to response if there any incident happen.

Ok. That's all for the introduction. I will come again with some detailed things (and hope some technical stuff too) later. Again, if you found any mistakes OR if you want to help me make this series better, feel free to contact me!
