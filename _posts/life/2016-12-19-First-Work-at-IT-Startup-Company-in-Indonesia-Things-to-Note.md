Hello! First, I’d like to say that it’s very happy writing this as (the new) catalina.id first post. One other Catalina’s mother ask me to write about what to be watched if we join our first IT startup company. I don’t have such experiences about benefit. Right now I am just on my 4th month working on IT startup (find it on my bio! haha). However I have a big interest on benefit matter. I like to know how each company attracts the prospectivce employees. 

Now, I will list some points to be reviewed.

### Employee Status

First to note is about employee status. In general, there are three types of employee status: probation, contract, and permanent. Most startups use probation status for every new employees on a few months. Then, basically some companies appoint them to permanent status after passed the probation phase. However there are some companies that appoint employees on contract status first. Contract is a time-bound agreement, so if you resign before the defined contract time, you must pay some penalties. Then how about in the end of contract time? It depends on the company, they can upgrade it to other status (like permanent), or continue it, or if the company no longer needs your position, it probably comes to end work relationship.

### Salary

Startups generally have different approach on offering. They can offer some same-level (e.g. fresh graduate) employees on the same position with different salary. It mostly defined from the result of interview and screening process. I think experiences play big portion on defining it. Beside that, Start-up companies likely ask the candidate first, how much is the expected salary. I think one of the goal is to measure how precise we define our skills and experiences, then also how much we can contribute to the company. About how the salaries delivered is another matter. As far I ever know, most Indonesian startup come with a mainstream one-salary per month, although there is startup I ever know gives the salary every two-weeks like startups abroad. 

### THR and Bonus

Other to note is about some ++ to our salary. I know from an HR friend that in Indonesia THR is a must by the government. At least you can get one bonus at the minimum value of one salary (for companies I ever knew). Some company choose to give it on Ied and some others depend to the employee’s religion. Beside THR, other ++ to your salary are generally come from annual bonus (can be more than 1x a year), though not all company do this and accumulate all in salary. 

### Income Tax, BPJS Health Care Security, and BPJS National Social Security

There are such things to note if you work in Indonesia. An income tax is a must and there will be related with your NPWP. However just be happy, that most startups I ever heard covered the tax all from company. It will be calculated by your basic salary. Other thing is BPJS. Fyi, BPJS is not only about health insurance. There are two types of BPJS: BPJS health care security and BPJS national social security, many startups already cover them too. You can googling to get more info, but both of them are mandatory for all worker in Indonesia. Oh ya, you have to know that one of BPJS national social security program called JHT is like a savings deposit that you can get it back on the age of 55. So, make sure your company or you aware with these three mandatory deductions. 

### Health Insurance

Last point I explained about BPJS health care security, but generally a great company gives you more. Basically companies will provide a health insurance for any inpatient case. Besides that, you can ask the company about outpatient sick, vision care (eye glasses/soft lenses), and dental care. I think not all companies give that things, it is an optional for company, but just remind about that matter. One thing, if you are married, or even already have child, don’t forget to ask more about the health insurance, is it covers your family too or not. 

### Meal

There are many startups now provide meals to the employees. Some give breakfast, some other lunch, some other also give dinner, and some can give all of that things. Yeah still this one is an optional benefit you can consider when join to startup company.

### Work Time 

First we talk about weekly working hours, for a full-time position, normally it is on 40 hours, though some company use less or more than it. Then, to be watched is job schedule each day. Is it a regular (9-6 or 8-5 with 1 hour break) or a flexible 8 hours each day, or even a flexible 40 hours each week or maybe shifting? However, for a flexible one, just make sure the total hours are same with the agreement. Because I ever heard story about a “flexible” working hours that comes with a high work loads then come into overtimes. You can ask your company how they handle overtime case. As far I know, there will be compensation or dispensation.

### Leave

From one of the reference below I know that a company must gives a personal leave rules, which is 1 day/month or 12 days/year. Besides that, there are some other leave types like: sick leave, maternity, paternity, marriage, compassionate, etc., which is truly i don’t know is it mandatory by the government or not. However just ask that because generally it is included to your benefit.You can check more on the references.

### Stock

This is a startup special benefit. Some startups now offer stock benefit for the employees. Usually it’s given after such period of work or given for special rising employees. So it may be a nice benefit for you when your startup comes to big valuations or even profitable state.

Yeah! There are 9 things to be noted in benefit matter when we choose to join any startups. Still, there are other benefits can’t be listed here e.g. Training participation, Community based course (non-working session), etc. Oh ya, one more, I think how big a startup will treat you different opportunity. Working on a small/new startup will give you greater chances to be lead and influential people, then working on a big startup more give you experiences on a large scale startup environment and it can also has a seniority and career path.
