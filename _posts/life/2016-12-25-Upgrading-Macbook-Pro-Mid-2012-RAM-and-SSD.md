My Macbook Pro mid 2012 comes with 4 GB memory and 500 GB hard drive. Somehow after using it for few months, I found that this macbook ran very slow and the memory was always full. I’m not sure, but other says that OSX memory management is poor. Beside that, I have already saved some money up, so anyway, I decided to upgrade my memory to 16 GB and hard drive to solid state drive.

## Things to Buy
-----

### 1. Memory


I read on [the apple site](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201165) that I can only upgrade my memory to maximum `8 GB`. But I saw some videos on YouTube ([for example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pGYYqyIgMY)) that I can even upgrade it to `16 GB`. So, I decided to upgrade it to `16 GB` (`2 x 8 GB`).

Now the next question is, which memory should I buy? After searching through the [Amazon.de site](https://www.amazon.de) while checking the specification from [apple site](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201165), there were two that I considered buying: [Crucial](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B008PSEHAS) and [Corsair](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B009EH010E). Here are some thoughts on deciding to buy which one of the two.


<div class="row">
  <div class="large-12 columns">
    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th> </th>
          <th>Crucial</th>
          <th>Corsair</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td><strong>Price (on 23-12-2016)</strong></td>
          <td>EUR 103,99</td>
          <td>EUR 122,89</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><strong>Reputation</strong></td>
          <td><a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/4682629?start=0&tstart=0">Doesn’t usually fail</a></td>
          <td>Seems fail more often</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><strong>Official Site</strong></td>
          <td><a href="http://www.crucial.com/usa/en/compatible-upgrade-for/Apple/macbook-pro-(13-inch-and-15-inch,-mid-2012)">It mentioned that the memory is compatible with Macbook Pro mid 2012</a></td>
          <td>It mentioned that it is compatible to mac, but didn’t define which macbook</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><strong>Customer Service</strong></td>
          <td>Good</td>
          <td>Don't know</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
  </div>
</div>

Basically, I would just use the rule of thumb `More expensive is much better`, but seeing that [Corsair failed more often](http://forums.macrumors.com/threads/crucial-vs-corsair-ram.1493726/) and Crucial’s official site mentioned that the memory is compatible with my macbook pro, I decided to buy the Crucial one. I bought it for `EUR 79,89` on Oct 3rd 2016. It was a nice price, but I forgot if there was a discount at that time. 

### 2. Solid State Drive (SSD)

I was planning to buy 1 TB SSD, then there was a sale for [750 GB Crucial MX300 SSD](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B01DUNLMUU) on Cyber Week Amazon. It costed `EUR 129`, while now (on Dec 23rd 2016) it costs `EUR 186.95` and it is out of stock both on Amazon.de and Crucial official site. So... it tempted me to buy the drive.

</figure>

Sure, I still need to read some reviews about the drive, is it good or not. I read [an article](http://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-ssds/) which said that Crucial MX300 is nearly as fast as Samsung 850 EVO and cheaper at higher capacities. Samsung 850 EVO was the best SSD that was suggested at that time (Nov 2016) based on the combinations of price, performance, and capacity. The article also said that Crucial MX300 was their runner-up pick. The downside of Crucial MX300 is the shorter warranty. Well, then as I was simple-minded, I bought 750 GB Crucial MX300.

### 3. Other Equipments

Other than the two main things before, there were two others to buy: screwdrivers. The first screwdriver is type of `PH 00`, it is used for opening the back cover of macbook. It is a small plus-sign screwdriver. I bought it on [Amazon.de](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B00IS2F6C4) while buying the memory. It costed around `EUR 3.99`. The second screwdriver is type of `Torx T6`, it is used for loosening and tightening the screw on the drive. It is a small hexagon-sign screwdrive. I bought it on a supermarket and it costed around `EUR 5.49`. But it was also equipped with PH 00, so I shouldn’t have bought PH 00 before.

## Things To Do
-----

### 1. Preparation
I upgraded the memory and the drive one at a time. The memory was upgraded about 3-4 weeks before the drive. So, I didn’t have to prepare anything, just go change the memory. But when I wanted to upgrade the drive, I had to create installation media on USB drive and moved files on the previous drive to another drive. I followed [the apple guide](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201372) to create a bootable installation media to USB.

### 2. Change the Memory
I will not guide you through the steps to change the memory, but here is the tutorial that I followed to change my memory.

## Finally
-----

This is my experience upgrading macbook pro by myself. In total, I spent about `EUR 218.37` or around `Rp 3 millions`. Well, it costed much money, but I think it was worth it rather than saving money up more until `EUR 2000` to buy new macbook pro 2015 with 16 GB memory and 512 GB drive. I would need a long long time to gather that amount of money. Though my macbook pro i5 processor is outdated ([not that much outdated](http://ark.intel.com/compare/84985,67355)), I’m happy enough to find my macbook pro is now flawless, yeay!
